The life of every citizen of every nation is impacted by a
vast multitude of individuals who wield significant influence each day.</p>

<p>Consider: millions of elected officials,
appointed judges, lawyers, police officers, bureaucrats, military officers, business executives and managers, those
involved in church leadership, educators, medical practitioners and hospital administrators. How might we pray for
these individuals?</p>

that we can pray for people in authority. Donâ€™t overwhelm
yourself. Select one person or group of people and then
pray one of these things each day for them.
